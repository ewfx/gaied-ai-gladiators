Subject: Request for Loan Closure Confirmation

Dear Customer Support,

I am reaching out regarding my recent request for the closure of my personal loan. Despite clearing all dues last month, I have not yet received an official confirmation. 

The Issue I am facing is that my credit report still shows an active loan, which is impacting my credit score. Please verify and send me a final closure letter with the updated Expiration Date.

Name: Priya Sharma  
Deal Name: Personal Loan #874512  

Awaiting your prompt response.

Regards,  
Priya Sharma
