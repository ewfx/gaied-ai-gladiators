Subject: Incorrect Loan EMI Deduction

Dear Loan Department,

There is a serious Problem with my loan EMI deduction. The Amount deducted from my bank account this month does not match my loan agreement. My EMI is ₹10,000, but ₹12,500 was withdrawn.

I have raised this Issue multiple times but have not received a resolution. Please rectify the Amount discrepancy and confirm the correct Expiration Date of my loan.

Name: Amit Verma  
Deal Name: Auto Loan #963214  

This needs to be addressed immediately.

Best regards,  
Amit Verma
