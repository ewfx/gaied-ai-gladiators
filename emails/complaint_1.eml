Subject: Urgent Loan Issue - Incorrect Amount Charged

Dear Loan Servicing Team,

I am writing to report a major Problem with my loan account. I recently noticed that the Amount debited from my account is incorrect. The agreed-upon installment was ₹15,000, but I was charged ₹18,500 instead. 

Additionally, I have not received a proper breakdown of my outstanding balance, and there seems to be a discrepancy in the Expiration Date of my loan agreement. 

Please look into this Issue and provide me with the correct Amount due. Also, update my records accordingly.

Name: Rajesh Malhotra  
Deal Name: Home Loan #548721  

I request an urgent resolution to this matter.

Sincerely,  
Rajesh Malhotra
